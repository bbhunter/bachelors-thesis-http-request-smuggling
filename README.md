# Bachelor's thesis on HTTP Request Smuggling

During the spring of 2021, we (Mattias Grenfeldt and Asta Olofsson) wrote our bachelor's thesis in Computer Science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. We studied HTTP Request Smuggling.

Once all issues found have been fixed by the affected vendors, we will publish here the code used for the test harness, the test requests and which systems are which in the anonymized report.
